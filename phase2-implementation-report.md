# Omnimage Phase-2 Implementation Report

_Last updated: 2025-06-20_

This document captures **everything developed and modified during the Phase-2 implementation sprint** (the entire lifetime of this chat session).  It serves as a historical record and a hand-off reference for future contributors.

---

## 1. Backend (Priority 1)

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Project structure** | Created `backend/app/` package, `routes/`, `uploads/`, `thumbnails/`, `static/` folders |
| **App factory** | `backend/app/__init__.py` builds and configures the Flask application, enables CORS, ensures upload folders exist, registers blueprints, and exposes a `/ping` health endpoint |
| **Image API** | `backend/app/routes/images.py` blueprint provides:<br>• `GET /api/images` – list metadata<br>• `POST /api/images/upload` – upload files (with Pillow mime validation)<br>• `GET /api/image/<filename>` – serve originals<br>• `DELETE /api/image/<filename>` – delete files |
| **Blueprint registry** | `backend/app/routes/__init__.py` re-exports the `images_bp` for app factory |
| **Entry point** | `backend/run.py` runs the app on `0.0.0.0:5000` in debug mode |

#### Validation
• `python run.py` starts without errors (tested in venv)  
• All endpoints respond 200 and correct data types.

---

## 2. Front-end TypeScript Migration (Priority 2)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/hooks/useAppState.ts` | Replaced legacy React Context with **Zustand** store; typed `ImageMeta`, stats, logs, selection APIs |
| `src/hooks/useResizePanel.ts` | Dual-panel aware resizing hook, converted to TS, optional `side` param, resize callbacks |
| Services | • `apiService.ts` – typed fetch, upload, delete, React-Query helpers  
• `imageParser.ts` – metadata extraction helper  
• `themeService.ts` – CSS-var based theming, persistence |
| Config | `tsconfig.json` (strict), installed `@types/*`, React-Query, Zustand, Radix UI, Tailwind Merge |

---

## 3. Component Architecture (Priority 3)

*Created folder hierarchy `components/layout`, `components/panels`, `components/ui`.*

### Layout
* **`AppLayout.tsx`** – 3-panel flex layout, integrates resize logic, Header, Footer.

### Panels
* **LeftPanel** – Radix Collapsible tool sections (Upload / Transform / Settings).  Collapse state persisted.
* **MiddlePanel** – Shows `FileDropZone` when nothing selected; otherwise full-size preview + metadata.
* **RightPanel** – Gallery grid powered by React-Query; selection toggles and visual borders.

### Header / Footer
* Theme toggle, brand, placeholders for status & stats.

---

## 4. Core UI Primitives (Priority 4)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Button.tsx` | Tailwind variants (`primary`, `secondary`), loading indicator |
| `Card.tsx` | Consistent bordered container |
| `ResizeHandle.tsx` | Visual 1-px drag bar for both sides |
| `ImageCard.tsx` | Thumbnail wrapper with border on selection |
| `LoadingSpinner.tsx` | Reusable animated SVG |
| `FileDropZone.tsx` | Drag-and-drop upload component using `react-dropzone`; integrates with React-Query cache invalidation |

---

## 5. State Management & Persistence (Priority 5 & extras)

* `stores/imageStore.ts` – uploaded list & multi-select set.
* `stores/uiStore.ts` – **NOW persisted** via `zustand/middleware/persist` (localStorage):
  * `leftWidth`, `rightWidth`
  * panel `collapsed` map
  * `theme`
* `AppLayout` & `LeftPanel` connected to the store, so widths/collapses survive reload.

---

## 6. Configuration, Theming & Build Tooling (Priority 6)

* Tailwind `tailwind.config.js` – content globs, CSS-variable colours.
* Global CSS `index.css` – dark/light vars, basic resets.
* Vite template files updated (`index.html` loads `main.tsx`).
* TypeScript compiler flag `allowImportingTsExtensions` enabled.

---

## 7. Main Integration (Priority 7)

* `App.tsx` – wraps `AppLayout`.
* `main.tsx` – React 18 root, React-Query `QueryClientProvider`.

---

## 8. Integration & Testing (Priority 8)

1. **Drag-and-drop upload → backend** – verified OK; gallery updates automatically.
2. **Selection** – click thumbnail → preview + metadata in middle.
3. **Resizing** – both side panels drag smoothly; sizes persisted.
4. **Theme toggle** – light/dark via CSS vars, preference persisted.
5. **TypeScript** – `npx tsc --noEmit` passes (strict) after every change.
6. **Vite dev server** – runs on nearest free port, hot-reload OK.

---

## 9. Fixes & Polishing

* Resolved `onSuccess` overload typing issue by switching to `useEffect` pattern.
* Added MIME-type validation on upload.
* Removed old `.jsx/.js` references and switched imports to TS versions.
* Added `allowImportingTsExtensions` after Vite hot-reload issue.

## 10. Success-Criteria Checklist ✅

Backend | Front-end | Integration
---|---|---
Flask starts w/o error | React app starts clean | FE ↔ BE communication works
Image API ok | 3-panel layout OK | End-to-end upload-display OK
Upload works | Panels resizable | Panel & theme state persist
Images served w/ correct MIME | Theme toggle | Basic error handling present
 | Drag-and-drop upload |  
 | Gallery & selection |  
 | Collapsible sections |  
 | No TS errors |  

_All check-boxes in `implementation-tasks.md` were marked as completed._

## 11. Running the Project Locally

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install flask flask-cors pillow
python run.py            # runs on http://localhost:5000
```

### Front-end
```bash
cd frontend
npm install             # once
npm run dev             # opens http://localhost:5173 (or next free port)
```

Hard-refresh the browser if you ever get the old Vite template.

---

## 12. Next Potential Enhancements (out of scope for Phase-2)

* Remove leftover legacy JS/JSX files completely.
* Add toast notifications / error boundaries.
* Implement additional tools in `LeftPanel` (Transform etc.).
* Production build & deployment pipeline.
